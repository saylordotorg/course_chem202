**Unit 9: Catalysis** <span id="9"></span> 
*In general, catalysts can be divided into two categories—heterogeneous
and homogeneous.  In a heterogeneous reaction system, the catalyst is in
a different phase than are the reactants.  Consider, for example, the
synthesis of isopropylbenzene, where isopropylbenzene is produced by
alkylation of benzene with propylene using a crystalline zeolite (an
aluminum silicate molecular sieve)as a catalyst.  The reagents are in
gas phase, and the reaction takes place only when these reagents are
activated on the zeolite (solid) surface.  In homogeneous catalysis, on
the other hand, the reagents and the catalyst are in the same phase,
usually dissolved in solution.  Consider, for example, olefin metathesis
using Grubbs’s catalyst, where both reagents and the catalyst (a
ruthenium-based carbine) are dissolved in the same solution.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will draw upon much of the knowledge of inorganic
chemistry you have accumulated thus far in your studies in order to
understand catalytic cycles in industrial applications.  Industrial
applications studied in this unit specifically include the conversion of
ammonia to nitric acid, the Haber process, and the Contact Process.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.2: 2.5 hours       

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Define heterogenous and homogeneous catalysts and give examples of
    each.
-   Explain the effect of catalysts on activation energies and reaction
    rates.
-   Discuss industrial applications of catalysts and give some specific
    examples.

     Instructions: Please read the entire webpage.  This material
    explains the basic concepts of catalysis.  The two major types of
    catalysis are homogeneous, where the reactants and catalyst are in
    the same phase, and heterogeneous, where the reactants and the
    catalyst are in different phases.  Examples of each are given.

     Instructions: Please read the entire webpage.  The conversion of
    ammonia to nitric acid is covered in detail on this page.  Please
    follow the links to read more about the Contact Process, for the
    production of sulfuric acid, and the Haber Process, for the
    production of ammonia.  Also note whether the processes involve
    homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis.
