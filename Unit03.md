**Unit 3: Transition Metals** <span id="3"></span> 
*Transition metals differ from s- and p-block metals because electrons
in the d orbitals are available for coordination and bonding.  Each atom
has a total of 5 d orbitals, accommodating up to 10 electrons total.  In
a metal complex, these d orbitals do not possess the same energy as they
do in single isolated atoms; rather, they have different energies that
are determined by their specific molecular geometry and their
coordinated ligands.  Electrons populate the low energy d orbitals
first; however, these electrons can be easily excited from a low energy
d orbital to a higher energy d orbital (a process known as “electronic
excitation”) or can be easily removed from the metal complex (a process
known as “ionization”).  The physical/chemical behavior and reactivity
of a transition metal depend strongly on the number of d-electrons in
the molecule.  In this unit, you will learn how d orbitals are organized
in a metal complex and how electrons populate these orbitals.  The
resulting electronic structure of the transition metal complexes
determines properties such as magnetism and color. *
