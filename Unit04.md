**Unit 4: Electronic Spectra of Transition Metal Complexes** <span
id="4"></span> 
*As mentioned in the previous unit, electrons in d orbitals can be
easily excited to higher energy d orbitals.  The intense colors of
transition metal complexes are indicative of these transitions.  The
unique absorption spectra that arise from metal complexes are often used
in trace metal analysis by spectrophotometric techniques.  Electronic
excitations are measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy, which will be
discussed in this unit.  Other spectroscopic techniques used for metal
complexes will be discussed in the next unit.  *
