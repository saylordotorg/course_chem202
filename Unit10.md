**Unit 10: Practical Applications of Inorganic Compounds** <span
id="10"></span> 
*Inorganic compounds and organometallic compounds have many interesting
real-world applications.  Some simple compounds, such as
cis-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>], are the basis for
successful chemotherapy drugs.  Medicinal inorganic chemistry as a
discipline has only existed for about the last 30 years, since the
discovery of the antitumor activity of cisplatin,
cis-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>].  Pt-based
combination chemotherapy remains the mainstay for the treatment of solid
malignancies (especially testicular, ovarian, and small cell lung
cancers).  In this unit, we will also learn about the application of
other transition metal complexes to medicine.*  
  
 *Other organometallic complexes exhibit unique photophysical
properties, such as light absorption and light emissions, that find
useful applications in solar cells and electronic displays. 
Exploitation of the redox properties of metal complexes allows new
generations of batteries to constantly emerge into the market.  This
unit looks at the practical applications and new technologies in each of
these areas.  *
