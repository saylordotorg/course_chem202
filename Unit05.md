**Unit 5: Spectroscopy of Transition Metal Complexes** <span
id="5"></span> 
*Spectroscopic techniques are usually associated with organic molecules
and analytical methods.  However, inorganic chemists also use these
physical methods to identify compounds and explore their practical
applications.  The interaction of radiation in infrared (IR)
spectroscopy, or magnetic fields in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy,
with metal complexes, allows examination of their physical properties. 
This unit discusses how these spectra are produced as well as what
information can be obtained from the spectra.  In particular, EPR of
these complexes has proven useful in the fields of semiconductors and
biochemistry for predicting chemical properties.      *
