**Unit 8: Reaction Mechanisms of d-Metal Complexes** <span
id="8"></span> 
*Ligands in a metal ion complex can be substituted by other ligands to
give the new metal complex certain novel chemical or physical
properties.  Ligand substitutions can occur via a number of different
mechanisms.  In metal complexes with different ligands, some ligands can
be substituted faster and easier than other ligands.  The geometries of
molecules also play an important role in substitution reactions.  In
order to make a prediction of the reaction product, the mechanism of
ligand substitution must be identified.   *

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 7.5 hours to complete.

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

     Instructions: Please read the entire webpage and watch the
    seven-second video clip at the end of the text.  Please also attempt
    “CALCULATION \# ONE” and “CALCULATION \# TWO” contained within the
    text.  The chelate effect is presented with regard to stability and
    chelation.  It is important to note that monodentate ligands are
    easier to displace, and therefore they are considered less
    favorable, than polydentate ligands.
