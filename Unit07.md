**Unit 7: Oxidation and Reduction Chemistry** <span id="7"></span> 

*One of the most unique properties of transition metals is their ability
to take multiple oxidation states.  This ability is extremely important
in reaction mechanisms, such as the “oxidative addition” or “reductive
elimination” of ligands, which will be discussed in the next unit. 
Oxidation states are also critical in determining the total electron
count, geometrical shape, and magnetic properties of the metal
complexes.  In fact, the reactivity of transition metals and their metal
complexes is highly dependent on their oxidation states and redox
properties.  Biologically important molecules utilize these abilities,
especially in enzymes.  For example, iron usually has a +2 or +3 charge;
however, it has been observed as a +4 or even +5 charge in the
transition state of methane monooxygenase.  You will learn about these
exceptions in your bioinorganic chemistry course.*
