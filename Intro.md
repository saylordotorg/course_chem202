Course Syllabus for "CHEM202: Advanced Inorganic Chemistry"
-----------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Inorganic Chemistry is designed to give you the knowledge to
explain everyday phenomena of inorganic complexes. You will study the
various aspects of their physical and chemical properties and learn how
to determine the practical applications that these complexes can have in
industrial, analytical, and medicinal chemistry. This course will begin
with the discussion of symmetry and point group theory and its
applications in the field of vibrational spectroscopy. We will then
study molecular orbital (MO) theory specifically applied to metal
organic complexes. MO theory will be critical in understanding the
following: 1) the relative position of ligands in the spectrochemical
series, 2) the electronic transitions and related selection rules, and
3) the application of spectroscopy of metals. The course will then move
onto the study of the oxidation states of transition metals and their
redox properties. A firm grasp of the chemical redox properties of
transition metals is critical to understanding their reaction mechanisms
and stability in solution. We will then look at catalysis reactions
utilizing inorganic complexes, including industrial practices. Lastly,
we will take a look at some real-world applications of transition metal
complexes in the fields of medicinal chemistry, solar energy, electronic
displays, and batteries.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  
  

-   Explain symmetry and point group theory and demonstrate knowledge of
    the mathematical method by which aspects of molecular symmetry can
    be determined.
-   Use molecular symmetry to predict or explain the chemical properties
    of a molecule, such as dipole moment and allowed spectroscopic
    transitions.
-   Construct simple molecular orbital diagrams and obtain bonding
    information from them.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of valence shell electron pair
    repulsion (VSEPR), which is used for predicting the shapes of
    individual molecules.
-   Explain spectroscopic information obtained from coordination
    complexes.
-   Identify the chemical and physical properties of transition metals.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of transition metal organometallics.
-   Define the role of catalysts and explain how they affect the
    activation energy and reaction rate of a chemical reaction.
-   Identify the mechanisms of both ligand substitution and redox
    processes in transition metal complexes.
-   Discuss some current, real-world applications of transition metal
    complexes in the fields of medicinal chemistry, solar energy,
    electronic displays, and ion batteries.
