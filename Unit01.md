**Unit 1: Symmetry** <span id="1"></span> 
*The concept of symmetry is critical to understanding certain physical
properties of metal compounds, such as vibrational modes.  In this unit,
we will discuss specific symmetry elements, including reflection planes,
rotation axes, and inversion centers.  While a molecule can have many
symmetry elements, some will specifically determine the molecule’s
physical properties.  This unit teaches you how to assign symmetry
elements and point groups to a given molecule.  You will learn to
interpret the character tables, which will help you prioritize symmetry
elements and classify molecules according to their respective point
groups.  Note that certain characteristic properties of molecules, which
may include polarity, chirality, and vibrational mode, correspond to
each point group.  Character tables will allow you to identify
spectroscopic properties of the compounds.     *

    Symmetry”](http://youtu.be/RrSJmMgoDbc) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Please watch the video (runtime = 5:38 minutes). 
    This video illustrates the three basic elements of symmetry.  Please
    note that there are more than three point groups; however, some
    arise from a combination of the three basic elements.  (For example,
    an improper rotation, S, arises from a rotation, C, combined with a
    mirror plane, ?.)

    Theory”](http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Physical_Chemistry/Symmetry/Group_Theory:_Theory) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the entire webpage.  Once you have
    familiarized yourself with the symmetry elements and terminology,
    the bulk of information can be condensed into the flowchart
    presented in Table 2.12.  Please follow the link under the “Symmetry
    Point Groups” section for more information on each of the individual
    point groups.

     Instructions:  Please read all sections.  This material may also be
    downloaded as a PDF in pamphlet form.  Point groups are primarily
    used by crystallographers for symmetry notation in place of the
    group theory methods described previously.  Also note that
    Schoenflies notation is an older notation system and is listed
    alongside the Hermann-Mauguin notation as such.
