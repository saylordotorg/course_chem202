**Unit 2: Molecular Orbital Theory and Symmetry** <span id="2"></span> 
*Molecular orbital (MO) theory is a detailed explanation of how
electrons are distributed in molecules.  In your organic chemistry
courses, valence bond theory (VBT) was used to explain chemical bonding
and molecular structure.  VBT allows that each atom in a molecule
retains its own electrons, located in atomic orbitals.  In this unit, MO
theory will be introduced.  MO theory assumes that electrons in a
molecule do not belong to single atoms but to the entire molecule as a
whole.  It also maintains that electrons are not located in atomic
orbitals but molecular orbitals, located in specific spatial regions
within the molecule.  These molecular orbitals are used to explain the
molecule’s chemical behavior and reactivity.  Knowledge of molecular
orbitals is essential to understanding the spectrochemical series and
predicting ligand substitution in metal complexes.*
