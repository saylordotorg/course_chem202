**Unit 6: Organometallics of Transition Metals** <span id="6"></span> 
*Organometallic chemistry is the study of chemical compounds containing
bonds between carbon atom(s) and a metal.  Organometallic chemistry
combines aspects of inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry***. **
*The properties of these complexes are largely dependent on the
molecular orbital splittings involved.  These were discussed in Unit 3,
which you may wish to revisit at this time.  Organometallic complexes
have characteristics of both organic molecules and transition metals,
and therefore they have a wide variety of applications, both current and
potential.  Many biological molecules, like hemoglobin and chlorophyll,
are actually organometallic complexes.    *

     Instructions: Please read the entire webpage.  This material
    examines the relationship between a central metal ion and its
    ligands, or what is bound to it.  Discussion also includes different
    types of ligands, starting with simple anion and monodentate ligands
    and progressing to polydentate ligands.

     Instructions: Please read the entire webpage.  The material
    includes terminology relating to ligands and their binding nature as
    well as several structures of the ligands themselves.  Oftentimes,
    ligands are represented by abbreviation only, so it is useful to
    familiarize yourself with their structure here.

     Instructions: Please read the entire webpage.  This site presents
    more complex problems dealing with determining the coordination
    numbers of molecules.  It also defines a few more terms.  Focus on
    the terminology here; aromatic ring systems and coordination numbers
    will be addressed in subunit 6.3.
